# data run on multiple machines

## Map Reduce
-- Batch Gradient Descent:
m = 400 examples 

Steps:
1. Split data to run on 4 machines
2. Each machine Uses 1/4 of the examples and calculates theta(j):= ...............
3. Combine results in master server

## Multi-core machines
Send data to each core on same machine and later combine results
